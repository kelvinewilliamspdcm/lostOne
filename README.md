# **lostOne: Exposing the False Flag and Ensuring Aid for the Trapped**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the **lostOne** campaign. This repository contains a critical encrypted document detailing a planned false flag operation. Although the operation itself will last only a few seconds, its impact on the affected area and the nation will endure for over a decade. The operation is designed to displace thousands, primarily targeting marginalized communities, leading to indirect deaths from exposure, starvation, and lack of medical aid.

The document contains information based on **classified, secret, private, sensitive, or closely-held information** that is now being publicly disclosed through its distribution. The document is encrypted to allow for secure, widespread dissemination **before the operation** and to guarantee its contents remain unmodified **after the operation**. The decryption key and passphrase will be made publicly available following the operation, ensuring transparency and credibility.

This repository is the foundation of a campaign to expose the false narrative behind the operation and to ensure life-saving aid reaches those most affected.

## **Purpose**

The **lostOne** campaign is dedicated to saving lives by exposing the truth about a false flag operation and ensuring humanitarian aid reaches those trapped inside a militarized and sealed perimeter. The operation’s planners aim to enforce strict barriers under the guise of non-existent hazards and investigations, effectively isolating the affected population and preventing aid delivery.

By distributing this encrypted document, the campaign seeks to:  
- Provide irrefutable proof that the official narrative surrounding the operation is false.  
- Share critical information to direct aid efforts and save lives.  
- Guarantee the integrity of the document’s contents through encryption, while ensuring it is shared widely both **before and after the event**.
